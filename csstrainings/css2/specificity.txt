The amount of specificity a selector has is measured using four different values (or components), which can be thought of as thousands, hundreds, tens, and ones â€” four single digits in four columns:

Thousands: Score one in this column if the declaration is inside a style attribute, aka inline styles. Such declarations don't have selectors, so their specificity is always 1000.
Hundreds: Score one in this column for each ID selector contained inside the overall selector.
Tens: Score one in this column for each class selector, attribute selector, or pseudo-class contained inside the overall selector.
Ones: Score one in this column for each element selector or pseudo-element contained inside the overall selector.
